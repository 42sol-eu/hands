# Welcome to Hands

The fundamental library for building a test automation framework.

Hands is the group of Python library that provides a set of tools and utilities to help you build and maintain a robust test automation framework. It is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use, making it suitable for a wide range of testing or automation scenarios.

!! tip "Flexibility and versatility (squared)"
    
    Hands naming is derived from the versitility and flexibility of a human hand. Build with five fingers around a palm. Consiting of  27 bones. And most humans have two of them. (So tell me: "Why should we limit our testing efforts to one tool or framework? Would you try do do something complex with one hand only?")  

A comprehensive overview and guide to testing tools and methodologies for modern software development.

## What is Hands?

- **Hands gives you freedom**: There are several testing frameworks available like `pytest`, `robotframework` or `behave`. However, they often come with a set of conditions, constraints and limitations that you often choose by selecting the framework. Hands is not a testing framework, but a set of tools and utilities that will help you to build your own test automation - even including other frameworks if you want to and have more than one if you need.

- **Hands is a curated collection** of testing tools, best practices, and methodologies designed to help developers and teams build robust, reliable software. Whether you're just starting with testing or looking to enhance your existing testing strategy, this documentation provides practical guidance and recommendations.
 
- **Hands is flexible**: Whether you are testing web applications, mobile apps, APIs, or any other type of software, Hands provides the flexibility to adapt to your specific testing needs.

- **Hands is extensible**: You can easily extend Hands with your own custom libraries and plugins, allowing you to tailor the framework to your specific needs.


## Features

- **Hands is easy to use**: With a simple and intuitive API, extensive documentation. Hands makes it easy to get started with test automation, even if you have little or no experience. It will not force you to use specific tools like `bash` scripts or `makefiles`, but you can use and integrate them if you want to.

- **Hands aims for the whole deal**: From unit testing frameworks to end-to-end testing solutions.

- **Best practices**: Industry-proven methodologies and strategies.

- **Practical examples**: Real-world code examples and use cases.

- **Framework agnostic**: Covering tools across different languages and frameworks
