## Documentation Guidelines

!!! info "We believe in hands on" 

    Instead of writing long guide lines, read into our documentation and start tapping the beat.
    Find the melody and start humming...

### Code Examples

- Use realistic, runnable examples
- Include necessary imports and setup
- Add comments to explain complex parts
- Test your examples before submitting 

!!! info "We believe handy organization" 

    Moving stuff around is a day to day business,
    especially if you are working in a set of packages. Therefore we strongly believe in file and project identification. (Check out our file head and use `scaphoid file stamp` to keep you and us sane).
